# Documentation for Shiny app

## Overall setup
My Shiny app to calculate the length of the third side of a triangle can be found here: https://davidrip83.shinyapps.io/Shiny/

The application takes the following inputs:
- Length of side x: integer with the value of the length of side x of the right triangle
- Length of side y: integer with the value of the length of side y of the right triangle

After you click the 'Submit' button it will output the length of side z

## More information
The goal of my shiny application is to calculate the side z of a right triangle with sides x and y. For this calculation the app uses the Pythagorean theorem.

Subgoals are:
- Allowing users to change the input data for x and y
- Displaying the data users have inputted
- Using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of side z
- Displaying the length of side z
